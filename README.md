## Introduction

This is a paper I wrote on why Awk may finally fill the bill as a systems
programming language. More detail on it is found in the paper itself.
I am publishing it on GitHub because I want to. So there.

To format the paper, just use `texi2pdf awk-sys-prog.texi`.

The file `awk.pdf` is Henry Spencer's original paper, to which my paper
is a reply. It is made available by permission. I thank him.
